# TSP_BruteForce
• The input of the traveling salesman (BRUTE FORCE) algorithm is A graph represented as an
adjacency matrix or adjacency list filled by random integers ranging from 10 to 110.

• The output of this algorithm is the shortest path (tour) that visits every vertex in the graph
exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. This path is represented as a list of vertices in
the order they are visited. The algorithm also returns the total distance of this path, which is
the sum of the distance between each consecutive pair of vertices in the path.

• The Algorithm efficiency is O(n!).
